# Ubuntu Linux
First you need to download the Ubuntu ISO file from the [official website](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop).  
I can highly recommend the latest LTS (Long Term Support) version. They are super stable.  

Now the question is, do you want to install Ubuntu on a real machine or in a virtual machine?
