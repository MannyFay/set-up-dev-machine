# Set Up Dev Machine
...you get into a new company, have this old computer in the basement or you are at a friend and want to set up a new computer for him because he wanna start with development...
Here the pain starts. Set up a machine again, uff! Again this pain, again this time consuming work, again this monkey work.  

For my it is one of the most annoying things in my developer life. I don't care which machine (Windows sucks by the way (my personal opinion)) - I want to start with my work as fast as possible with my complete environment.
I don't like to search for all the stuff I need. Every time I forget something to install... pain out of hell.

Because of that I wrote this documentation. Here, I describe how I set up my development environment.  
Maybe you feel sometime the same and this documentation helps you a little bit - I hope so.

I like to do my work mostly in the terminal. So I use a lot of command line tools.  
My favorite editor is Neovim. I use it for all my projects. Because of that, I have some [configuration files](https://github.com/MannyFay/dotfiles) for it.  
Actually I explore [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/). With this, I can automate the installation of my development environment.
Mostly I do full stack web development with PHP (Laravel, Twig, Everest), JS, TS, Node.js, (Express.js, Vue.js, React, Alpine.js) HTML, CSS (TailwindCSS, Bootstrap, Sass, Less), Docker bla bla bla...
But! -> You will find Rust, C-Languages, Python and other stuff in my projects too. I'm a developer and I like to explore new things.
